Once the oil heats-up add around 3 pieces of dried jeprox and fry each side until the color turns golden brown and the fish starts to curl. Make sure that the oil is not too hot when you put the fish in. This will prevent it from getting burnt quickly and will avoid a bitter aftertaste. Perform this step until all the fish are consumed.
Using a spoon, scoop some hot oil from the pan and pour-it over the fish so that the opposite side will get cooked and crispy. Turning the fish over will not cook the fish equally since it is already curly.
Remove the fried jeprox from the hot pan. Place in a plate lined with paper towels.

Gently turn-over the eggplant (side with ground chicken facing down). Use a wide spatula to do this. Continue to cook in medium heat for 3 minutes. While doing this, scoop a quarter of cooked ground chicken and arrange it on top of the other side. Pour some egg on top of the ground chicken and scoop some cooking oil on top.
